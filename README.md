VIAME-Web is a web interface for performing data management, video annotation, and running a portion of the algorithms stored
within the VIAME (https://github.com/VIAME/VIAME) repository. When compiled, docker instances for VIAME-Web can be run either
as local servers or online in web services. A sample instance of VIAME-Web is running on a public server at https://viame.kitware.com.
Additional documentation will be available in the future for users.

* [Client Development Docs](client/README.md)
* [Docker Getting Started Guide](docker/README.md)

## Code Architecture

VIAME-Web uses [Girder](https://girder.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for data management and has a typical girder + girder worker +
docker architecture. Command-line executables for VIAME and FFmpeg are built inside the worker docker image. See docker scripts
for additional details.

### Client

The client application is a standard [@vue/cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) application.

### Server

The Rest API server is a Girder3 plugin. Generally, it needs a running MongoDB instance, Python3, and a python environment, 
Run `pip install` on the against the server directory. Then `girder build` , `girder serve` to start the girder server. Refer to
[Girder3 documentation](https://girder.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and the included docker scripts for details.

### Worker

The processing server is a typical Girder worker tasks. Generally, it needs a running RabbitMQ instance. Python3, and a python environment.
Run `pip install` on the against the server directory. Then `girder-worker -l info` to start girder worker.

## Example Data

### Input

VIAME-Web takes two different kinds of input data, either a video file (e.g. .mpg) or an image sequence. Both types can
be optionally accompanied with a CSV file containing video annotations. Example input sequences are available at
https://viame.kitware.com/girder#collections.

### Output

When running an algorithmic pipelines or performing manual video annotation (and saving the annotations with the save
button) output CSV files are produced containing output detections. Simultaneously a detection plot of results
is shown underneath each video sequence.
