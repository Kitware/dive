This folder contains the deployment configuration for Viame-Web


Typically ansible is run using `ansible-playbook` over `ssh`, however since the server this is deployed on isn't accessable via `ssh`, we can't use normal CI/Deployment methods. Instead, ansible needs to be run with a `systemd` timer, and this `systemd` timer needs to be setup locally. Due to the uptime requirements, this deployment is run on a schedule, instead of directly after changes to the `master` branch.

# Requirements
The server must have the following things:
- The repository cloned to `/home/viame`
- Ansible
- The Ansible [Docker Compose](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/docker_compose_module.html) module


# systemd service
To initiate the `systemd` timer, run the following command:

```
ansible-playbook docker/ansible/systemd.yml
```

If you need to remove this timer and service, run the following command:

```
ansible-playbook docker/ansible/clean.systemd.yml
```

# Operation
Once the service is initiated, it will run the `deploy.yml` playbook at the interval specified in `viame-deploy.timer`. This will update the server with any changes.

`deploy.yml` will read in variables from `.vars.yml`. These are not tracked in source control, as they're assumed to contain sensitive information. The following variables are expected to be defined in `.vars.yml`:

- `deploy_email_address` - The email address that the emails will be sent from
- `notify_email_address` - The email address that the emails will be sent to
