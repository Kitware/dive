# DIVE Documentation

This is the user documentation for DIVE, an open-source annotation and analysis platform which can be run either as a web or desktop application. DIVE was originally built for, and has deep integration with, the [VIAME toolkit](https://www.viametoolkit.org/), but it can also be integrated with other automated analytics.
