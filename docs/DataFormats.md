# Data Formats

DIVE Desktop and Web support a number of annotation and configuration formats.  The following formats can be uploaded or imported alongside your media and will be automatically parsed.

* DIVE Annotation JSON (default annotation format)
* DIVE Configuration JSON
* VIAME CSV
* KPF (KWIVER Packet Format)
* COCO and KWCOCO (web only)

## DIVE Annotation JSON

!!! info
    The current DIVE schema version is v2.  Version 2 was introduced in DIVE version 1.9.0.  It is backward-compatible with v1.

Files are typically named `result_{dataset-name}.json`.  Their schema is described as follows.

``` typescript
/** AnnotationSchema is the schema of the annotation DIVE JSON file */
interface AnnotationSchema {
  tracks: Record<string, TrackData>;
  groups: Record<string, GroupData>;
  version: 2;
}

interface TrackData {
  id: AnnotationId;
  meta: Record<string, unknown>;
  attributes: Record<string, unknown>;
  confidencePairs: Array<[string, number]>;
  begin: number;
  end: number;
  features: Array<Feature>;
}

interface GroupData {
  id: AnnotationId;
  meta: Record<string, unknown>;
  attributes: Record<string, unknown>;
  confidencePairs: Array<[string, number]>;
  begin: number;
  end: number;
  /**
   * members describes the track members of a group,
   * including sub-intervals that they are participating in the group.
   */
  members: Record<AnnotationId, {
    ranges: [number, number][];
  }>;
}

interface Feature {
  frame: number;
  flick?: Readonly<number>;
  interpolate?: boolean;
  keyframe?: boolean;
  bounds?: [number, number, number, number]; // [x1, y1, x2, y2] as (left, top), (bottom, right)
  geometry?: GeoJSON.FeatureCollection<GeoJSON.Point | GeoJSON.Polygon | GeoJSON.LineString | GeoJSON.Point>;
  fishLength?: number;
  attributes?: Record<string, unknown>;
  head?: [number, number];
  tail?: [number, number];
}
```

The full source [TrackData definition can be found here](https://github.com/Kitware/dive/blob/main/client/src/track.ts) as a TypeScript interface.

### Example JSON File

This is a relatively simple example, and many optional fields are not included.

```json
{
  "version": 2,

  "tracks": {
    // Track 1 is a true multi-frame track
    "1": {
      "id": 1,
      "meta": {},
      "attributes": {},
      "confidencePairs": [["fish", 0.87], ["rock", 0.22]],
      "features": [
        { "frame": 0, "bounds": [0, 0, 10, 10], "interpolate": true },
        { "frame": 3, "bounds": [10, 10, 20, 20] },
      ],
      "begin": 0,
      "end": 2,
    },
    // Track 2 is a simple single-frame bounding box detection
    "2": {
      "id": 2,
      "meta": {},
      "attributes": {},
      "confidencePairs": [["scallop", 0.67]],
      "features": [
        { "frame": 3, "bounds": [10, 10, 20, 20] },
      ],
      "begin": 3,
      "end": 3,
    },
  },

  "groups": {
    "1": {
      "id": 1,
      "meta": {},
      "attributes": {},
      "confidencePairs": [["underwater-stuff", 1.0]],
      "members": {
        // The fish is a group member on frame 0, 1, and 3.
        // The scallop is only a group member at frame 3.
        "1": { "ranges": [[0, 1], [3, 3]] },
        "2": { "ranges": [[3, 3]] },
      },
      "begin": 0,
      "end": 2,
    }
  }
}
```

## DIVE Configuration JSON

This information provides the specification for an individual dataset.  It consists of the following.

* Allowed types (or labels) and their appearances are defined by `customTypeStyling` and `customGroupStyling`.
* Preset confidence filters for those types are defined in `confidenceFilters`
* Track and Detection attribute specifications are defined in `attributes`

The full [DatasetMetaMutable definition can be found here](https://github.com/Kitware/dive/blob/main/client/dive-common/apispec.ts).

```typescript
interface DatasetMetaMutable {
  version: number;
  customTypeStyling?: Record<string, CustomStyle>;
  customGroupStyling?: Record<string, CustomStyle>;
  confidenceFilters?: Record<string, number>;
  attributes?: Readonly<Record<string, Attribute>>;
}
```

## VIAME CSV

Read the [VIAME CSV Specification](https://viame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/section_links/detection_file_conversions.html).

!!! warning
    VIAME CSV is the format that DIVE exports to.  It doesn't support all features of the annotator (like groups) so you may need to use the DIVE Json format.  It's easier to work with.

## KWIVER Packet Format (KPF)

DIVE supports [MEVA KPF](https://mevadata.org/)

* Read the [KPF Specification](https://kwiver-diva.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kpf.html)
* See example data in [meva-data-repo](https://gitlab.kitware.com/meva/meva-data-repo/)

!!! info
    KPF is typically broken into 3 files, but DIVE only supports annotations being loaded as a single file. However, the 3-file breakdown is just convention and KPF can be loaded from a single combined file.

    ```bash
    # Example: create a sinlge KPF yaml annotation file for use in DIVE
    cat 2018-03-07.11-05-07.11-10-07.school.G339.*.yml > combined.yml
    ```

## COCO and KWCOCO

Only supported on web.

* Read the [COCO Specification](https://cocodataset.org/#format-data)
* Read the [KWCOCO Specification](https://kwcoco.readthedocs.io/en/release/getting_started.html)
