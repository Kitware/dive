# Sharing and Permissions Management

This information will be relevant to teams where several people need to work on the same data.

## Concepts

By default, data updloaded to your personal user space follows these conventions.

* Data in the `Public` folder is readable by all registered users, but writable only by you.
* Data in the `Private` folder is only visible to you.

## Managing Permissions

To allow other users to edit or run jobs on your datasets:

* Navigate to your data in the data browser.
* Right click a dataset folder or directory to share.
  * ![Right Click Menu](images/Sharing/RightClickMenu.png)
* Search for and select users you want to grant permissions for.
* Select the correct permissions in the drop-down next to each user.
  * ![Search For Users](images/Sharing/SearchBar.png)
* **important**: Be sure to enable `Include subfolders` at the bottom of the dialog.
  * ![Toggle Include Subfolders](images/Sharing/Toggles.png)
* Click save.

These users should now be able to view and edit your data.

## Sharing URLs

You can copy and paste any URL from the address bar and share with collaborators.  This includes folders in the data browser as well as direct links to the annotation editor.
