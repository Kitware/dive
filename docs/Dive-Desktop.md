# DIVE Desktop

DIVE is available as an electron based desktop application with deep [VIAME](https://github.com/viame/viame) integration.

DIVE Desktop has most of the same UI and features as VIAME Web **without** requiring a network connection or a server installation.

## Installation

[Download and install the package for your OS from GitHub](https://github.com/VIAME/VIAME-Web/releases)

## Features

Full Windows and Linux support.  Annotation support for MacOS.

* Annotate video and images on your computer (Instead of uploading to a server)
* Run pipelines and training on multiple datasets using locally installed VIAME

## Usage

DIVE Desktop generally requires a local installtion of the VIAME toolkit to be fully functional.  It works on its own as a media annotator, but requires VIAME to perform analysis pipelines and model training.
